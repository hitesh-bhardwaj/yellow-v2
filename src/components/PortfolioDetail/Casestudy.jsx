                Meet Rita & Ibrahim, an incredibly talented couple that left
                their established careers to pursue their dreams of creating a
                bold new fine jewelry brand. Rebellion was a major theme
                throughout everything - from the playful, unexpectedness of the
                pieces created to it being a purely DTC brand to the personality
                of the founders. This segued into the essence of the brand being
                centered on the idea of “The Art of Rebellion” - a narrative
                that was all about celebrating self-expression, confidence,
                colour, creativity, boldness and femininity.

                  Naming is always one of the most challenging aspects of
                  creating a brand. It&apos;s incredibly personal, subjective and
                  often all the great ideas you come up with are taken. We
                  explored many themes and ideas, focusing predominantly on
                  evocative and associative names - names that communicated the
                  brand idea without being too descriptive (our favourite kind
                  of names)! And thus Maveroc was born.

                  With a strategic foundation in place, a name we all fell in
                  love with and the essence of rebellion at the heart of the
                  brand, we developed the brand identity that consisted of a
                  vibrant colour palette made up of our favourite colours - pink
                  and yellow! The colours of passion, optimism and creativity.
                  We selected contemporary, bold typefaces, and created a visual
                  language that allowed the hero of our story to shine: the
                  jewelry. This was followed by developing all the supporting
                  touchpoints where the brand really comes to life - from
                  creating the packaging and image style to working closely with
                  the founders and various partners to design, direct and launch
                  the website, social media and photoshoots.
